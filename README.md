# <img src="screenshots/app_icon.png" alt="app icon" width="35"/> Petroleum Oil and Gas Production App
Calculate IPR and Travers curves that show the productive capacity and well performance and determine the pressure distribution and rates along oil and gas wells.

## Calculate IPR
The app provides three methods to calculate the IPR 
- Vogel and Standing
- Fetkovich
- Jones et al


## Test the app:
you can use these values to test the app

### IPR Test :


| Header 1 | Value    | Unit |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Average Reservoir Pressure (Pres)    | 3200     | Psig|
| Bubble Point Pressure (Pb)    | 2200     | Psig|
| Pressure (Pwf)    | 1340     | Psig|
| Flow Rate (QI)    | 1000     | STB/Day|


using (Vogel and Standing) method :

Average Reservoir Pressure (Pres) = 3200 Psig

Bubble Point Pressure (Pb) = 2200 Psig

Pressure (Pwf) = 1340 Psig

Flow Rate (QI) = 1000 STB/Day


To calculate the Travers Curves :

you can use the IPR data above and add the next data to the Out Flow Input Data


Depth (d) = 7000 ft

Well Head Pressure = 200 Psig

Gas Liquid Ration (GLR) = 500 scf/STB

American Petroleum Institute (API) = 35

Gas Specific Gravity (SG) = 0.65

Water Fraction (Fw) = 50

Tubing Size Values :

d1 = 1.995 in

d2 = 2.441 in

d3 = 2.992 in

The Results will gives you graph contains both IPR and Travers Cureves Tubing Size Diameteres used like that :
