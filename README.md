Calculate IPR and Travers curves that show the productive capacity and well performance and determine the pressure distribution and rates along oil and gas wells.

Test the app:
you can use these values to test the app from a real well-data

For calculate (IPR) :

using (Vogel and Standing) method :

Average Reservoir Pressure (Pres) = 3200 Psig

Bubble Point Pressure (Pb) = 2200 Psig

Pressure (Pwf) = 1340 Psig

Flow Rate (QI) = 1000 STB/Day


To calculate the Travers Curves :

you can use the IPR data above and add the next data to the Out Flow Input Data


Depth (d) = 7000 ft

Well Head Pressure = 200 Psig

Gas Liquid Ration (GLR) = 500 scf/STB

American Petroleum Institute (API) = 35

Gas Specific Gravity (SG) = 0.65

Water Fraction (Fw) = 50

Tubing Size Values :

d1 = 1.995 in

d2 = 2.441 in

d3 = 2.992 in

The Results will gives you graph contains both IPR and Travers Cureves Tubing Size Diameteres used like that :
